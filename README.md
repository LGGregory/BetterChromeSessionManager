# Better Chrome Session Manager

By which I mean, an Opera 12.x session manager, written for Chrome.

Maybe some improvements based on other modern Chrome session managers.

Every other session manager fails in some key way...

Mostly they don't save scrollpos or history. This is unacceptable, as that's a key part of a session.

## Features

- Save, load multiple sessions
- Save everything, or by window
- Maintain scroll position in tabs when restoring
- Maintain History in tabs when restoring
- Restore groupings, pinned tabs, loading states



## Notes

Not everything that Opera allowed access to can be accessed through Chrome's Web Extension api. 

Nearly everything that can still be accessed is much harder.

This is my first real project, so expect slopiness.

I have no eye for aesthetics, so expect programmer graphics.
